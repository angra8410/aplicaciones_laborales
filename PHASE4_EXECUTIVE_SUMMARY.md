**Example:** SQL, Python, Power BI, ETL, Dashboards  
**Output:** "4/6 technical skills matched: sql, dashboard, automation, excel"

### 2. Experience Depth & Relevance (25% weight)
**What:** Years of experience + responsibility level + measurable impact  
**Example:** 5+ years, individual contributor, 6 quantifiable achievements  
**Output:** "91% - Excellent experience match"

### 3. Domain Knowledge (20% weight)
**What:** Familiarity with industry/business domain  
**Example:** Healthcare, E-commerce, BI, Analytics  
**Output:** "2/3 domain areas matched: bi_reporting, analytics"

### 4. Soft Skills & Cultural Fit (15% weight)
**What:** Collaboration, communication, leadership abilities  
**Example:** Stakeholder management, training, cross-functional work  
**Output:** "100% - All required soft skills demonstrated"

### 5. Achievement Quality (10% weight)
**What:** Quality of evidence mapped to requirements  
**Example:** High-quality = specific achievement with metrics  
**Output:** "4 high-quality achievements mapped to 7 requirements"
